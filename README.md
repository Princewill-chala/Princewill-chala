I'm a **Cloud Engineer** passionate about solving real-world problems through technology.  
I enjoy working with **AWS**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, **Python**, and **network security tools**.  
My curiosity drives me toward a world where **creativity meets impact** — building things that not only work but matter.
